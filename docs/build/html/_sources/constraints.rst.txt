Constraints:
============


Budget:
-------
    $12,000 in design costs and $2,000 per year for server and maintenance costs.


Compatibility:
--------------


Client Compatibility:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    In the initial application, the application needs to be compatible with different
    browsers and different versions of the same browser, and for the common browser
    on the market: Chrome, Firefox, IE, Safari, Edge, Opera, it works. As for future,
    the application needs to be compatible with different operation systems.


Server Compatibility:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The application system need mobility. When there are necessary system update to move
    the application, itâ€™s easy to transfer. For different server, the application must
    to be compatible with them.


Complexity:
-----------


Spatial Complexity:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    For the simplicity of the application, we limit the memory footprint of the application
    to the client, requiring the browser to open the application with a system memory footprint
    of less than 200MB. On the server side, we limit the memory footprint of the system to 2GB.


Time Complexity:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    We explained in response time requirements that the response time is not more than 5 seconds.
    Therefore, the design system needs to consider the time complexity of the system, which requires
    us to improve the efficiency of the algorithm.
