Non-Functional Requirements:
============================

Response Time:
--------------
    When the data is small and the response time is short, however, when it comes to thousands
    of data, it may be different. We need the response time is less than 5 seconds.


UI Design:
----------
    The web application only need simple pages, not too many functions, and the traditional
    UI design is not satisfactory. We decide that the UI design needs to use the bootstrap framework.


Maintain:
---------
In the application, we provide telephone and email to contact the maintenance staff,
and there are special maintenance workers to check the system every week to ensure
the normal operation of the system.


Confidentiality Policy:
-----------------------
    In order to ensure the security of the data, a special web security engineer will
    conduct the system security analysis after the design of the system to ensure that
    the data will not be stolen. In the process of normal use, the experimental data
    will not be divulged without the agreement of the owner.


Robustness:
------------
The system can automatically adjust or terminate when the server disk is damaged, the
memory footprint is too large, the network overload or malicious attack, etc., causes
the system to be wrong.
